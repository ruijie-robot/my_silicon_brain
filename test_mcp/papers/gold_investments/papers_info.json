    "summary": "We demonstrate that the tail dependence should always be taken into account\nas a proxy for systematic risk of loss for investments. We provide the clear\nstatistical evidence of that the structure of investment portfolios on a\nregulated market should be adjusted to the price of gold. Our finding suggests\nthat the active bartering of oil for goods would prevent collapsing the\nnational market facing international sanctions.",

    "summary": "Gold and bitcoin are not new to us, but with limited cash and time, given\nonly the past stream of the daily price of gold and bitcoin, it is a kind of\nnew problem for us to develop a certain model and determine the best strategy\nto get the most return. Here, our team members analyzed the data provided and\nfinally made a unified system of models to predict the price and evaluate the\nrisk and return in our act of investment, and we name this series of models and\nmeasurements as CTP Model. This is a model which can determine and describe\nwhat transaction should the trader make each day and what is the certain\nmaximum return he will get under different risk levels.",
